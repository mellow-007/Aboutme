## My Projects

One of my projects is **MellowUPIreportsFormater**, where I developed a Python program that formats UPI merchant transaction reports into a user-friendly format. This program is designed to simplify the process of working with UPI merchant transaction data and make it more accessible for analysis. It offers the following features:

- **Versatile Input Support:** The program supports various input file formats like .zip/.csv, allowing users to work with transaction reports from different sources.

- **Formatted Output:** It generates formatted reports that are easy to read and analyze in both .xlsx and .pdf format, facilitating better insights from UPI merchant transaction data.

You can explore this project on GitHub:

Feel free to check it out, provide feedback, or use it for your transaction data formatting needs!

Feel free to connect with me, especially if you share a passion for electrical and electronics engineering or if you'd like to collaborate on a project!
